DeteTo Project: Planning and Development Report
Introduction
Project Overview
DeteTo is a learning-focused project designed to analyze ice hockey gameplay videos and automatically detect key events such as goals, penalties, fights, saves, and other significant occurrences. Additionally, the system will identify the players involved in these events, potentially through jersey number recognition, player tracking, or other identifiers. As a single-developer project in the early planning phase, the emphasis is on building a functional prototype using accessible tools and technologies to gain hands-on experience in computer vision, machine learning, and software development.
The core input will be video files (e.g., MP4 recordings of ice hockey games), and the output could include annotated videos, event timelines, or reports highlighting detected events and players. This project draws from fields like video analysis, object detection, and event classification, making it an excellent opportunity to learn AI/ML integration.
Objectives

Primary: Develop an end-to-end system to detect and classify ice hockey events from videos.
Secondary: Identify players involved in events; provide user-friendly outputs for review.
Learning Goals: Gain proficiency in Python, computer vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV), ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch), and project management as a solo developer.
Scope Limitations: Start with a minimum viable product (MVP) focusing on 3-5 key events (e.g., goals, penalties, shots on goal). Expand later if time allows. Assume publicly available videos for testing; no real-time streaming in MVP.
