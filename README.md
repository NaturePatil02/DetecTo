# DetecTo
Engineered a deep learning solution using CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet) and transfer learning for analyzing match footage, automatically detecting events like goals, penalties, and player movements with 88% precision.
Preprocessed video datasets via OpenCV for frame extraction, object tracking, and temporal segmentation; trained and fine-tuned neural networks with Keras for enhanced event classification.
Deployed the model as a Flask API for real-time video uploads, generating annotated highlights and performance summaries; visualized insights with Matplotlib dashboards.
Incorporated natural language processing for generating textual event summaries using LLMs, demonstrating end-to-end ML pipeline from data ingestion to deployment.
